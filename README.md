# Quantum Machine Learning Playground

The **Quantum Machine Learning (QML) Playground** is an interactive web application designed to visualize and explore the inner workings of quantum machine learning models in an intuitive and educational way. Inspired by classical tools like TensorFlow Playground, it focuses on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) — particularly the *data re-uploading universal quantum classifier* — and introduces visual metaphors such as Bloch spheres and the **Q-simplex** to interpret quantum state evolution.

Now extended beyond classification, the playground also supports **regression tasks**, **uncertainty quantification**, and **regularization techniques**, enabling deeper exploration of quantum model performance and generalization.

Beyond basic model training, the playground now provides noise-aware analysis, robustness diagnostics, and gate-level sensitivity insights, enabling users to explore not only how quantum models learn, but also how they fail under realistic noise.

This playground is ideal for learners, educators, and researchers who want to explore QML models without requiring deep expertise in quantum hardware or simulators.

## 🧠 How the Quantum Model Works

The playground demonstrates the **data re-uploading variational quantum model**, a flexible architecture introduced by Pérez-Salinas et al. ([Quantum, 2020](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2020-02-06-226/)). This architecture repeatedly embeds classical features into quantum states using trainable gates, mimicking the depth and expressivity of classical neural networks.

Originally designed for classification, it now also supports **quantum regression**, expanding its educational and research potential.

This model was chosen because it is:

* Structurally similar to common **variational quantum circuit (VQC)** architectures
* **Simple enough to visualize** intuitively
* **Powerful enough to be universal**, capable of approximating any function in principle
* Flexible enough to illustrate **training dynamics**, **regularization effects**, and **uncertainty estimates** for regression tasks
